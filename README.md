# AOC 2023

Hey! I'm having some fun at doing https://adventofcode.com/ 2023 exercise

Probably I am far from the most optimal solutions in terms of data structures or performance; in any case, I am experimenting and having a lot of fun ðŸš€

Unfortunately, I came too late because I was too busy in December. Next year, I will try the day-by-day challenge! 

## Do you think my solution is cool or is it pure garbage?
